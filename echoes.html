<p>Welcome Comrades :D</p>

<p>I understand many of you might be really skeptical about the sudden jump in life from being a school kid to an independent college student. I was at the same place as you a couple of years ago. But trust me when i say, this is the best thing that can happen to you in your life.</p>

<p>IIIT-H provides you with a platform to achieve everything that you may have aspired for or looked forward to in a college life. Your life is gonna be a total roller coaster ride with many ups and downs but coming out of it successful with a happy face and writing your own odyssey is what IIIT-H teaches you.</p>

<p>The opportunities that IIIT-H provides you are limitless. You are free to pursue any interest of yours here. We have a very active community participating and organising various events related to Coding, Entrepreneurship, Cultural Activities, Research and what not. So gear up, because even if you want to just sit idle and waste time around, Sorry, IIIT won't let you :D You will definitely come out to be an asset to the society at the end of your journey, no matter what.</p>

<p>It is going to be very adventurous in the start with all the academic pressure, the race for ICPC and GSoC, managing all the time with the attendance policy and yet taking out time for your interests but this is what will shape you and make you a responsible person at the end. You will learn a lot of things with all your fellow batchmates who will be coming out from a very rich diversity. Tip: Make friends, lot of them. You will try a lot of new things that you never expected of in your Freshers, with practicing all night and finally showing out your talent to the masses. Yes, you will be tired but at same time, thrilled. You will be sleepless, but at same time happy. You will be far from home, but at same time make a new home :).</p>

<p>I wish all of you wonderful years ahead of you and all the best for all the wonderful opportunities that lie ahead. I know you will make the best of it and make a lot of memories. Welcome to IIIT :D.</p>

<p>When I walked into this college, I was a bundle of emotions. Scared, confused and excited, all at the same time. Soon, I met my batchmates, seniors, and it has been a rollercoaster ride ever since.</p>

<p>After getting over the initial shock of how different college is from school, ( or our coaching days ;) ), it amazed me to see the diverse and awesome set of people I found here. Coders, dancers, developers, musicians, bookworms, athletes, just about everybody has something great to offer.</p>

<p>The curriculum of CLD is pretty similar to CSE barring a few courses. It gives a perfect blend of computer sciences and working with language technologies. Working with the intricacies of Indian languages and dealing with them computationally is an upcoming field which fascinates me. While the workload may be heavier than you might expect, you’ll find yourself being surprised at every little detail you notice in a language you thought you knew for your whole life!</p>

<p>College is the time when we come out of our shells and try out all the activities and hobbies we had left behind. IIIT-H gives us an ample amount of opportunities to participate in cultural events throughout the year. Even better, we are encouraged to start something of our own ,may it be a club or an event, if we are truly interested. Be it inter house competitions, helping out with the college fest, hackathons, there is something for everyone!</p>

<p>Going to college is as much about finding out who you really are as it is about getting that degree. Explore, learn, work, and most importantly, have fun! Welcome to IIIT!</p>

<p>After my JEE(mains as well as advanced) I was waiting for a seat in counselling process, with the aggregate I got in 12th it seemed difficult to get seat in a good NIT. Then I was searching for the colleges which consider only the score of JEE-Mains and nothing else. Then, it all started. At first, I was shocked, because I didn’t even knew that there exists a IIIT in Hyderabad and then I applied for it and got a seat in BSD. I was again afraid thinking what will be my future? Coz, the branch in which I’m gonna join is not any regular branch. It’s a new curriculum started by IIIT-H for the first time in India and also my batch is the second one to join under this course. So, there were no pass-outs to clarify my doubts regarding my future! But, what else I can do when I’ve got no seat elsewhere. So, I’ve joined this college.</p>

<p>At first, I never used to talk with others. Throughout my 1st year my life was like “Me, My Room & My Laptop”. But once when I’ve stepped out of my room(at the end of my 1st year), I’ve seen a different world with wonderful friends, and many amazing experiences. So, what I suggest is ‘make friends, enjoy your stay, participate in all the events that happen’. The cult events here are awesome. Felicity is the main event in an academic year. Those three nights are the fun nights. And the batch trips are the ones where you’ll re-discover yourself. You have all the wonderful experiences waiting out here for you. </p>

<p>And an important thing is this college changes you from a KID to an ADULT. You’ll know your responsibilities, you’ll know what is life, you’ll have different experiences, the knowledge of which will be helpful maybe in your future! And remember, academics aren’t everything. Getting good grades and marks may fetch you a nice job but can’t fetch you the valuable experiences you get by being with your friends. </p>

<p>Hello folks! You’ve come to start a new journey! Guess what- You’ll probably love IIIT-H!
To give you a peek into what waits ahead - You are free from the shackles of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Dive into Comp. Sci.! Follow your passions! </p>

<p>I was really passionate about research when I joined in. In IIIT-H, we get a lot of freedom.
Yes! Explore your passions. I used to sit in random interesting lectures whenever I wanted to!
I got to learn, I got to explore the R&D Labs! I could do what I’ve been waiting for, finally! </p>

<p>The first year for me was exciting and a bit frightening. Frightened of the consequences of living one heck of a life. By not being told what should I study anymore - I was, and you are free to explore Linguistics, Economics, Electronics and much more! </p>

<p>The consequences of following your passions are indeed breath-taking!
Awesome friends, amazing time and even a few research paper in an international conference!
Want to try out Entrepreneurship? Go ahead!
Coding? Go ahead!
Web Development? Go ahead!
Opportunities are limitless, my friend!</p>


<p>Also, remember in your pursuit, the sayings of the wise- “With great freedom comes great responsibility”. The institute offers you some core courses that you ought to know well.
Tip: Master them! They’re essential in the long run. Do your assignments!
No, not on paper! Welcome to the evil OJ! You’ll know what that is, soon enough. :D </p>

<p>Make friends with your batchmates and seniors. They’re going to be some of your best buddies for the next few years, at least. Being a small but closely-knit community, everyone knows everyone - Juniors and seniors alike. They’ll help you in your moving past your hurdles, they’ll celebrate with you in your success!</p>

<p>Now is the time, my friends! Shed all the past fears, break from the shackl</p>

<p>CND at IIIT-H aims to train students in a niche domain of computer science's application. The idea is to use computer science in certain domains of theoretical scientific research broadly, these areas include interactions of biomolecules by studying their dynamics, studying techniques of studying these dynamics, genomics/proteomics and other prominent branches of bioinformatics, RNA bioinformatics, systems biology, quantum information theory, nanoparticle synthesis and cognitive neurosciences, which is still nascent. The program requires students to study a slightly modified course structure but allows them to take nearly all courses that CSE students take. Courses specific to the program help align interest and build foundation.</p>
<p>My experience in this program has been like that in any other scenario, with both highs and lows. It is a rigorous program and requires a lot of hard work. Science can't be studied without a lot or rigorous theoretic understanding. Professors here are more than one can ask for with all of them having decorated scientific careers. However, be warned that the program isn't a substitute for a regular CSE program. The 'N' makes a monumental difference in the aims of the program.</p>

		<p>Welcome to IIIT-H!</p>

<p>Amidst difficult times of counselling, I chose IIIT-H because of its emphasis on research. Not only has IIIT-H offered me opportunities that I had never thought of, but also it has moulded me into a responsible and confident person that I am now.</p>

<p>First few months were like an adventure, where you make a ton of friends with your batchmates and seniors, try new and different things you never dreamt of, follow your instincts, find your passions and make your own everlasting memories. From infinite assignments to never ending exams, from sleeping during lectures to working all night for Felicity, IIIT-H has taught me to learn from everything. It has taught me that I can pursue whatever I believe in, if I  try hard enough. It has taught me that Google has solution to every problem. :P </p>

<p>Been a part Social Media Team, Alumni Cell and Felicity, I have learnt that college offers ample opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities as well as those which help one build his/her personality. These past two years have been filled with many ups and downs but the most important thing one learn at IIIT-H is to “Never give up”. </p>

<p>We all have with us our set of dreams and this is the time to break free your cages and chase your dreams. I wish you happy 4/5 years(or more ;) ) of your life at IIIT-H and I hope you and me will make next Felicity, the best ever!
Welcome to the family.</p>

<p>Passed the meticulous security guards, walked through the intermittently lit  hostel corridor, and caught a glimpse of ever so many parents and students on my floor. I remember grudgingly going to the Orientation Day and listening to so many professors speak on the on goings of our college IIIT-H. We were assigned mentors from the second year to interact with us and help us get through our first days of college easily. I made 2 new friends that day and it was just the start!</p>

<p>Now let’s go two months down the lane. The guards knew me by name, and hostel felt like home; although I went home almost every weekend( mum missed me xD) I couldn’t wait to get back to college. In two months I made the best of friends and college became my second home! The frequent “meetings” we had in our balcony where we talked about our seniors who we interacted with were memories I will not forget. And then preparations for the Freshers cultural programme began. I met so many people, made so many friends – batchmates and seniors! But, there’s the academic pressure. Academics is most definitely a quintessential part of IIIT-H; I’m not going to lie to you about that. But, it’s very important for you to know, as juniors, that participating in extra curricular activities is equally important for you to grow in this university. And if you put your mind to it, you can divide time for both.</p>

<p>IIIT-H gives you opportunities for you to explore yourself. I have friends who never thought they could dance or sing so well before performing on stage. Our schooling might have been stringent but our college gives you so much freedom(yes, we have no curfew!) to do so much more. Let me remind you this, get to know all the clubs in our college. You’ll be surprised to know how many we have and never hesitate to participate in any!</p>

<p>So come out of your comfy shells, explore, make friends, learn, leave no stone unturned and have loads of fun, juniors! A hearty welcome to y’all! </p>

<p>Welcome to IIIT!</p>

<p>It still feels unreal that an year has passed since my first day here, I remember all of it, the
nerves, and the awkward small talk with people who were strangers back then, and are
comrades now. The first few days are an adventure, finding new friends in your batchmates,
your seniors, this is the time to follow your passion, let go of your fears, come out of your shell,
and join clubs that interest you! Trust me on this, clubs are an amazing way to build upon your
hobbies and interests.</p>

<p>One important thing that all of you need to understand is that school is over, last couple of years were tough, I know, but it is different now, you do not have a sword hanging above your neck
anymore. You’ve chosen your field, and now is the time to go out, explore it, and master it.</p>

<p>The first year should not just be about your semester courses and programming assignments,
you’ll have enough of that, don’t worry (or do?). I would rather encourage you all to explore our
labs, use IIIT for what it’s renowned. We have some of the best researchers in our country
developing technologies that will shape our future, use that proximity to sharpen yourselves,
something or the other will surely interest you, and there is so much to learn. :D</p>

<p>This is it people, the most creative period of your life has just started. Pursue your talents, go for
your dreams, aim for the stars, the world is your oyster today. It’s your college life, you’ll love it,
you’ll hate it, but at the end of it, when you exit that campus gate for the very last time, you’ll be
prepared to take on whatever the world throws at you.</p>

<p>Seize the day.</p>
<p>Also, ask for a chocolate-coffee at the Juice Canteen.</p>
<p>It’s awesome.</p>
